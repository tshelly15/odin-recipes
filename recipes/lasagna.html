  <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until browned</li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, parsley, basil, salt, and italian seasoning. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8-10 minutes. Drain noodles, rinse with cold water</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>preheat oven to 375 degrees</li>
    <li>To assemble: spread 1 1/2 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzerella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce over mozzerella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesean cheese.</li>
    <li>Repeat layers, top with remaining mozzerella and Parmesean cheese. Cover with foil: spray foil with cooking spray to prevent sticking, or don't let it touch the cheese</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes</li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving</li>
